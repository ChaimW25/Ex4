## introduction
In this project we were created and designed a Pokemon game.
The game is structured so that a directed weighted graph is given (you can read about that here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph)
 And given a list of Pokemons (with different values ​​for each) that are located on the edges of the graph. 

The main goal of the game - locate the agents who capture the pokemons and make the agent walk so that they capture as many pokemons as possible at high values, it means, maximize the overall score of the captured pokemons.

The game has different cases that are different in their attributes like: the struct of the graph, the position of the pokemons, the number of agents and their speed.

 We have written an algorithm that maximize the grades of the agents in capturing the pokemons in the different cases and difficulty levels. In addition, we have created a GUI (Graphical user interface) for the game that illustrates the original characters in the 'Pokemon' series.

Below: An image of the Pokemon agent! ('Ash Ketchum', in the series),:
